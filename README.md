# Codecademy Portfolio Project 2: Biodiversity in National Parks

This project was completed as a part of the Data Science Foundations section of the Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist career path curriculum (for section 2: Data Science Foundations II).

The objective of the project was to perform analysis on species data for a series of species found in a number of national parks. The motivation was to demonstrate ability to process and analyze datasets. The preceeding modules on the course studied hypothesis testing in Python, hence some chi-square tests have been used in analysis to observe the significance of relationships between the conservation statuses across flora and fauna species classifications.

The content of the analysis is contained within *report.ipynb*.

A key finding of the report was the observation that mammals had the highest proportion of protected species. Further analysis revealed that the only two animal species for which the proportion of protected species was statistically different to one another were mammals and reptiles. In light of the discovery that mammals were most endangered, this observation concerning mammals and reptiles may warrant further investigation.
